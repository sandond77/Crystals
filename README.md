#  Crystals Game

Crystals is a web-based game where players try to collect a specific number of points.

## How the Game Works
The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page. The crystals are assigned with four hidden values.

When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.


The player must strategize and determine what combination of crystal button clicks will result in the target score. Each crystal will have a random hidden value assigned to it until the player hits that crystal. The score counter will be updated with the crystals's value.

The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
